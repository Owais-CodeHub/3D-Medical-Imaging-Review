## Voxels to Vision: A Comprehensive Review Tracing the Evolution of 3D Medical Imaging Analysis from Classic CNNs to Emerging Foundation Models

This repository serves as a companion resource to our review paper *"Voxels to Vision"*.  
The review traces the evolution of **3D medical image analysis**, highlighting how the field has progressed from early deep learning architectures such as CNNs and RNNs, to generative models (VAEs, GANs, diffusion models), and more recently to large-scale **foundation models** that integrate vision, language, and multimodal pre-training.  

Our work provides:
- A **historical perspective** on how 3D medical imaging analysis has evolved over the last decade.  
- A **comparative discussion** of strengths, limitations, and applications of each paradigm across core tasks such as segmentation, detection, classification, reconstruction, and report generation.  
- Insights into **emerging research frontiers** including multimodal fusion, generalization across institutions, and the integration of trustworthy AI in clinical practice.  
- A curated collection of **resources** to support researchers and practitioners in the field.
