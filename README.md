## Voxels to Vision: A Comprehensive Review Tracing the Evolution of 3D Medical Imaging Analysis from Classic CNNs to Emerging Foundation Models

---

### üìñ About This Review
This repository serves as a companion resource to our review paper *"Voxels to Vision"*.  

The paper traces the **evolution of 3D medical image analysis**, highlighting the transformation from early deep learning architectures to modern foundation models. Specifically, it covers:  
- üèõÔ∏è **Classic Deep Learning Models** ‚Äì CNNs, RNNs, and early Transformers  
- üß™ **Generative Models** ‚Äì VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models for synthesis, augmentation, and reconstruction  
- üåç **Foundation Models** ‚Äì multimodal architectures that integrate vision, language, and large-scale pre-training for universal medical imaging tasks  

Our review provides:  
- A **historical perspective** on how 3D medical imaging has advanced over the past decade  
- **Comparative insights** into strengths, limitations, and performance across tasks such as segmentation, detection, classification, reconstruction, and report generation  
- Discussion of **emerging research frontiers** including multimodal fusion, cross-institution generalization, and trustworthy AI for clinical adoption  
- A **curated resource hub** for datasets and open-source code
